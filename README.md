# ng-dl
A downloader for Newgrounds

The sequel to ng-scrape. Currently it can only download art (adult ones not supported yet)

# To-do
Support all forms of media that can uploaded to Newgrounds (movies, music, games, etc...)

Support downloading Adult-only submissions (relies on CSRF fuckery so we will see if I ever get it to work, but considering this is open-source, they can just take a look at my solution and patch it)
